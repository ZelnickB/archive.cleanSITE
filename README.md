> The worst part of using a website generator, such as Weebly or Wix, is that you have to pay to remove one of the ads placed at the bottom of your page.  
  
![Weebly Advertisement Image](https://image.ibb.co/gwO05S/image.png "An ad from the website generator Weebly that is placed at the bottom of free users' webpages")
  
CleanSite allows these ads to be removed for all viewers of the website as soon as the page loads. Most likely, the users of your site will not even see the ad.
  
# Benifits
* CleanSite uses a quick HTML `<script>` element in the footer of your website in order to disable ads
* Besides the CleanSite code, there are no traces of the ad left on the page, even in the "Inspect element" tool
* Easy to enable on your website
* No credit to the author is required–what's the point of removing one ad to add another?
* Universal code disables ads on many popular webpage editors
* Completely open source–if you are using another website editor, you can use the code to create your own version of the program. Make sure to credit @ZelnickB on GitHub in your README document.
  
# Installation Notes
* See the [**Release Notes**](https://github.com/ZelnickB/cleanSITE/releases) for the latest release of the code to find the code to add to your webpage
* Paste the code into the **footer code** setting field of your webpage. *If you do not complete this step correctly, the code will not function.* Technically speaking, the ad itself has to load before the JavaScript can get rid of it.
  
## Installation Code
Code for installing the program will become available here when it is released.
